# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a variable within the function. An argument is what it is expected to do.

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable in a function. An arguments is the data you pass into the method's parameter.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map takes in a predefined variable and calls upon the values within its array. The parameters that are required are the given values within the array. I would need to go over .map again to as it's a new concept to me in order to properly state which parameters are optional.

Researched answer: An optional parameter (arr) lets you pass less numbers to a function and assigns a default value that holds the array.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:.map calls upon the variables in the array and allows you to change the values within it and insert new values into the array without changing the original. .filter will take out whatever values you tell the function the array doesn't need. ie if you say % 2 !== 0 it'll filter out whatever numbers don't evenly divide by 2 into 0.

Researched answer: map creates a new array which has the results from the iteration over the elements of the array and calls the function once for each element in the array in order. whereas filter creates a new array with elements that are provided from a called upon function. Filter also doesn't change the array

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: iteration is where when you call upon a function it goes through each value within the function and finds which value it can change depending on instructions from a function.

Researched answer: iteration goes through a sequence of instructions being repeated for each element and defines how to produce a sequence of value from an object.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function requires a named variable and sets up the condition of a code block that starts with curly braces. A method is like a function within a function that provides instructions on how  you're going call upon the variables within code block. 

Researched answer: A function is a block of code that performs specific tasks. it requires a name and optional parameters. The code block is enclosed by curly braces. A method is the property of an object that contains a function definition. They're stored as properties.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I'm not sure that we've covered hoisting in my class yet. It sounds like it allows you to call upon variables, functions, or methods elsewhere in your code.

Researched answer: Hoising defines the declarations at the top of the code before executions. It allows you to call functions before they appear in code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Classes: Class is an object template. In the constructor method properties and methods are assigned. This method is called everytime a class object is initialized.

2. Spread operator: A spread operator is used when all of the elements from an object or array need to be included in a new object or array.

3. React state: React state is an object that stores the dynamic data of a component and allows it to follow the changes between renderings. to declare state you need to use useSate hook.

4. React props: Props are used to pass data and values between components to get dynamic unique outputs.

5. DOM events: DOM events happen when there's a signal designating that something has occured that's triggered by an interaction between a user or by the browser. This can be a press of the button, when a webpage is loaded, when someone refreshes the page etc.
